# Mentored API Demo
## Goal
Learn to use APIs in addition to building React fundamentals. Use the DOG API to generate random photos of dogs with the press of a button. We will use `axios`, a HTTP Client library for Node.js, to make our requests. We will also learn to read documentation and important debugging skills

### Conceptual Checklist
- [ ] Understand the use of the React State Hook
- [ ] Understand the structure of an API request
- [ ] Understand how to make a request using the Axios library
- [ ] Learn to use the console in Chrome to debug and learn information about requests
- [ ] Get a better grasp of React syntax and React JSX
- [ ] Learn to read API documentation

## TODO
Generate a random dog picture everytime the generate button is hit on the page. We should be getting these dog pictures from the Dog CEO API website. Additionally, parse the URL such that we can get the breed.

- [ ] Fill out the generateDogPicture method and make a get request using axios
- [ ] Log the data to the console and read over the results with the devs
- [ ] Add the onClick functionality to the generator button
- [ ] Create state variables to house the breed and img text
- [ ] Add the states to the HTML components

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
